recursion = a way od solving a promble by having a fuction calling itself

->performing the same operation multiple times with different input parameters
->in every step we try smaller input to mak the promblem samller
->based on conditions in neeeded to stop the recursive otherwise infinite loop will occour

code
def openRecssianDoll(doll) :
    if doll ==1:
        print("all doll are opened")
    else:
        openRecssianDoll(doll-1)

recursive thinking is really important in programming and it helps you break done big problems into smaller ones easier to use 


when to choose the recursive function ?
1)->if you can divide the problems into similar problems 
->design an algorithm to compute the nth
->implement a method to compute all
->practice


2)the prominent range of recursion in data structures like tree and graph
3)interview
4)it is used in many algorithm(divide and conquer,greedy and dynamic programming)
