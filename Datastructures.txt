what is data stuctures ?
data stuctures are differentway of organizationdata on your computer that can be used efficiently.


what is algorithm ?
set of step to accomplish a task

algorithm
set os rules for a computer program to accomplish a task

input data ->> calculate the data ->> stop when answer found 

what makes a good algorithm ?
1) correctness
2) efficiency


types of algorithm ?
1) simple recursive algorithm
2) divide and conquer algorithm
3) dynamic programming algorithm
4) greedy algorithm
5) randomized algorithm
6) brute force algorithm

simple recursive algorithm
algorithm having another alogorithm inside algorithm

ex
algorithm Sum(A,n)
     if n=1
        retune a[0]
    s=Sum(A,n-1)
    s=s+A[n-1]
    retune s


2) divide and contraction   algorithm
divide the problem into samller subproblems of the same . type , and solve these subproblems recurively
combline the solution to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem
ex:- quick sort and merge sort
